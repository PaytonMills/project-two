           <p><b style="color: #fc9c54;" >WXYC 89.3</b> is a cornerstone of the Chapel Hill entertainment scene. With a studio located in the UNC Student Union, WXYC went on the air on March 17, 1977, with Joni Mitchell’s “You Turn Me On I’m a Radio”. From its earliest days in the late 70s, WXYC has been a leader in diverse and interesting programming, adopting changing forms of popular music long before they became popular in the mainstream without losing touch with the past. </p>
            <p>WXYC became a 24 hour a day/ 365 day a year radio station with a commitment to be consistent in quality and reliable enough to set your clock radio to.</p>

The autobiographical tale, filled with people Joel saw shuffle in and out of a Los Angeles bar during his time as a lounge singer, stands as one of the all-time best supporting-character studies.</p>
                    <p>Rolling Stone mused that Piano Man "represents a new seriousness and flexibility" for Joel, comparing it to the stylings of Elton John.  Reviewing the album, Billboard stated that it shows that Joel has a "fine shot at establishing himself as consistent quality AM artist with large scale songs and dynamic performing range.</p>
